# Rubycond
Pressure by Ruby Luminescence (PRL) software to determine pressure in diamond anvil cell experiments  

## Install

1) Download and install Miniconda **OR** Anaconda (NOT both):

   - Miniconda  
   https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/
  
   - Anaconda  
   https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/


2) from anaconda prompt (windows) or terminal (Ubuntu & MAC) create a virtual environment with name "my_env":

```bash
conda create -n my_env pip
```

3) activate the virtual environment with
```bash
conda activate my_env 
```

4) install rubycond with:

```bash

pip install rubycond
```

5) OPTIONAL: Install the [python-seabreeze](https://python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for the Ocean Optics spectrometers:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge seabreeze
seabreeze_os_setup
```

6) launch rubycond:

```bash

rubycond
```

## Shortcut

In windows the rubycond.exe can be found in the virtual environment Scripts folder, usually something like:  
- C:\Users\username\anaconda3\envs\my_env\Scripts
- C:\Users\username\miniconda\envs\my_env\Scripts

To check where the virtual environment has been installed:

```bash

conda env list 
```

# Manual

## Operating modes
**Rubycond** can operate in two modes, *Connected* or *Stand Alone*. If the parameter stand_alone in the the init file (*Rubycond_init.txt*) is set to False, **Rubycond** will start in *Stand Alone* mode. If the parameter stand_alone is set to True, **Rubycond** will try to load the spectrometer drivers and start in *Connected* mode. If an error occurs while opening the driver, **Rubycond** will start in *Stand Alone* mode.

## Logger :warning: Not Available in **_Stand Alone_** mode   
The logger will automatically create a **log file** in the log directory. A new file will be create if the log directory is changed. The filename format is: 

  - %y%m%d_%H%M%S.txt, i.e. 02 Jan 2024 12:03:04 => '240102_120304.txt'

The logger will save **3 files** for each log using the format:

  - %y%m%d_%H%M%S_header.rtf  
    - Main info of the measurement, including the fit results if the fit is selected
  - %y%m%d_%H%M%S_img.png
    - Image as displayed on the software
  - %y%m%d_%H%M%S_data.txt
    - All the data, including the fit results if the fit is selected

The logger will add a line to the **log file** with the following **parameters**:

  - Beginning of the **3 files** filename (starting with %y%m%d_%H%M%S)
  - [Unix time](https://www.epochconverter.com/) of the log
  - Measurement:Int Time (s)
  - Measurement:Accumulation
  - R1_center
  - R1_gamma
  - R1_fwhm

- C:\Users\username\anaconda3\envs\my_env\Lib\site-packages\rubycond

Init file example:

```
[Settings]
stand_alone = False

[Spectrometer]
calibration_i = 1
calibration_c1 = 1
calibration_c2 = 0
calibration_c3 = 0
sigma_vary = False
sigma (cm-1) = 0.637
```
